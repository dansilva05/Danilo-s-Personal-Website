        <h2>Earlier Early Life</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Childhood in Brazil</h3>
        <p>I spent my childhood in São Paulo, Brazil, always surrounded by family as it is very united. My father’s side of the family would often gather for barbecues, celebrations, and birthdays, often traveling from afar to get together. On my mother’s side, my grandmother’s house was always lively with relatives coming and going. My daily routine back then was: mornings with my grandma, afternoons at school, and evenings with my parents. I remember my childhood there in details — the warmth, the casual pace of life, and the endless summers at the beach house in the tropical heat. <i>I'd like note here that Brazil is a country full of vibrant culture and beauty, far beyond the prejudices</i>.</p>
        
        <h3>Life in Portugal</h3>
        <p>When I was 10, my family moved to Albufeira, Portugal, where I lived until I was 14. Life in Portugal was great, with a climate similar to Brazil's warmth. The language barrier wasn’t really a challenge — I only had to learn a few new words and expressions. My parents, on the other hand, struggled with both Portugal's vocabulary and pronunciation.
        In Portugal, I passed through my early teenage years, <i>in Porugal my personality was mostly shaped</i>, there I experienced a new culture, learned to appreciate new perspectives, and developed a love for sports and language.</p>
        
        <h3>New beginnings in Ireland</h3>
        <p>My family and I once again when I was 14, this time to Ireland, where I currently live. The reason is that even though both of my parents were employed, the high cost of living in a tourist city like Albufeira made life challenging. Here, I first lived in Mayo, where I completed my studies from 2nd to 6th Year. We later relocated to Waterford, where I currently attend SETU.
        The language barrier and the effects of the lockdown made adjusting to life in Ireland particularly difficult. During this time, some of my negative tendencies and habits got worse, but I know I can get past them.</p>
        <i class="impor">Overall, I believe living in different countries has made me more adaptable, resilient, and curious about the world around me.</i>

        <h2>The Pandemic and Its Impact</h2>
        <p>Like many others, I was affected by the pandemic. I'm naturally reserved and quite shy, so moving to <b>Ireland</b> and then going through <b>lockdown</b> soon after made adaptation even harder. Although the lockdown presented challenges for me in school, especially with <b>online classes</b>, it also gave me the opportunity to try out other interests and focus on <b>calisthenics</b>. Through training, I eventually reached some goals like going from an L-sit to a handstand in one move, even though it was only a few milliseconds hahaha - my balance is terrible.</p>
