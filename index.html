        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is <b>Danilo Oliveira da Silva</b>, but you can call me <span>Dan</span>. I’m a 19-year-old Software Systems Development student currently studying at <b><a href="https://www.setu.ie/">SETU Waterford</a></b>. I'm a brazilian born in <b>São Paulo, Brazil</b>, where I lived until I was 10. I then moved to <b>Albufeira, Portugal</b>, and later to <b>Ireland</b>, where I’ve been living since I was 14. I'm still young and don't have much to tell, but I'll try to share a bit about in this site!</p>
