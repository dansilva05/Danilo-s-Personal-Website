        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>Drawing is a passion I acquired when I was still a kid. Watching animations like <i>Dragon Ball</i>, <i>Knights of the Zodiac</i>, <i>Justice League</i>, etc., I thought to myself, I want to be able to do that — and to this day, I still have the same thought hahahaha.</p>

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>My love for reading started when I was a little guy who would sit beside my mom, asking her to read the Bible out loud and wanting to learn how to read myself. After I learned, I always loved the reading we did in class in subjects like Portuguese (my first language) and later English. As a child and teenager, I loved comics, especially the ones that made me question things I thought were important and whether they were really true. The first book I read without pictures was <i>The Odyssey</i> by Homer, and later <i>The Dream of a Ridiculous Man</i> by Dostoyevsky — who is now one of my favorite writers.</p>

            <h3>MMA</h3>
            <p>I discovered MMA through a friend from my previous church who practiced with another member who knew MMA and had taken classes all around the world. There, I learned the basics of stand-up and ground fighting. What I really enjoyed was Jiu-Jitsu and its submission (My favorite one was the kimura, hehe)</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I've had many interests throughout my life, some are still with me, and others I've left long ago. My interests can be summarized are:</p> Anthropology (history, languages, cultures, and the human experience), Philosophy, Religions, and Technology.

        <h2>Curiosities</h2>
        <p>I was a chubby kid from 5 to 10 years old. It only changed in Portugal, where I finally changed sodas for water and stopped eating so many snacks.</p>
        
        <h2>Sports</h2>
            <h3>Childhood Sports: Futsal &amp; Handball</h3>
            <p>As a child, even though I was chubby, I still loved playtime, especially when it involved running and jumping.</p>
            <p>During my time in Portugal, I spent 1 year playing Futsal and 2 years playing Olympic Handball. While doing handball, before training I would play around with my friends all day—running a lot—then I would have handball training with both juniors and seniors (even though I was young, I was part of both teams because of my skills). The training sessions lasted about 2 hours, and after training, I would still run home—20 minutes of non-stop running.</p>
            <p>In these two years of playing Handball, I participated in a few interschool championships.</p>

            <h3>Calisthenics</h3>
            <p>Before the lockdown, I didn’t do many activities after moving to Ireland, but it (the lockdown) served as a spring, making me workout at home, doing calisthenics every day. After arduous training, I was able to go from an L-sit to a handstand in one move (0.5 seconds, but still hahaha).</p>
